<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello, my name is Tamryn Foster, and I am an aspiring front-end developer
  based in South Africa. I recently began my journey into web development, with
  a strong desire to build a better future for my family and explore
  opportunities in the tech industry.
</p>

<p>
  So far, I have created beginner HTML projects such as a birthday invitation
  webpage and a Top 5 Movies website. These projects have allowed me to
  understand the basics of HTML and sparked my interest in learning more about
  web design and development. I am currently focused on improving my skills in
  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the goal of becoming a full-stack developer.
  I’m also learning about the importance of clean, accessible design and how
  websites can positively impact people’s lives..
</p>

<p>
  With a background in customer service and collections, I bring strong
  communication skills, attention to detail, and a willingness to grow and solve
  problems. As a wife and mother, I’m highly motivated to succeed in this field
  and work toward a remote career that offers flexibility and security for my
  family.
</p>

<p>
  Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I’m excited about this journey and look
  forward to connecting with others in the tech community as I grow.
