<h3>Anaconda: The Blood Orchid</h3>
<p>
  This was one of the first movies I ever watched, and it's still my go-to when
  I'm bored.
</p>
<p>
  It's a thrilling film with a solid cast, an engaging storyline, and even a few
  funny moments.

<h3>Dirty Dancing</h3>
<p>
  This classic never gets old. Every time I watch it, I end up dancing in my
  room!
</p>
<p>It's romantic, a bit dramatic, and always a great watch.</p>

<h3>Grown Ups</h3>
<p>
  One of the funniest movies and definitely one of Adam Sandler’s best. It’s
  always good for a laugh!
</p>

<p>
  A perfect mix of horror and suspense. One of the scariest movies out
  there—it'll have you hiding behind a pillow!
